# Food Inventory Helper
This application is aiming to help users to track food inventory and store recipes.

Further improvements are as follows:

- Add in expiry of dates, set notifications on expiring foods
- For perishable foods (ex. vegetables) with no explicit expiry dates, system should automatically suggest an expiry date
- On the front page of the app, app should be able to automatically suggest what to cook today based on what is in the house
- Frequency of recommendation should also take note of frequency of recipe used, and from time to time it should also 
suggest new recipes to try
